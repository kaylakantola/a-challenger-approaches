## PROBLEM

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## SOLUTION

Given a starting array of [1,2], and a max value, add together the last two items in the array.

If the sum is less than the max, add the sum to the end of the array, they recursively call the function again with this new array and the existing max value. If the sum is greater than the max, return the array.

Now you have an array of Fibonacci sequence numbers whose highest number is below your max.

You can then filter this array for numbers that are divisible by 2.

Take that filtered array and sum the numbers.
